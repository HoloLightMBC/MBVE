WORKS ONLY WITH Web version of ACE AND ONLY WITH ACE.(Some day i will make workshop version). Effects can be broken on some servers(sounds like they use workshop version).
Right now works on La Sagra, AWM Builder( But dont works on Combat server) i think MBE works on other servers too but i dont test.
Sounds like if you install MBE on ACE Dev effects will works on anyserver and acf, Acf3
Just copy all this folders in
